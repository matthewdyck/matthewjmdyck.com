    <h1>Matthew Dyck!</h1>

<h3>A quote from Daniel Dennet's <em> Elbow Room</em></h3>
    <p>“There are cases where the claim “I can do no other” is an avowal of frailty: suppose what I ought to do is get on the plane and fly to safety, but I stand rooted on the ground and confess I can do no other—because of my irrational and debilitating fear of flying. In such a case I can do no other, I claim, because my rational control faculty is impaired. But in other cases, like [Martin] Luther’s, when I say I cannot do otherwise I mean I cannot because I see so clearly what the situation is and because my rational control faculty is not impaired. It is too obvious what to do; reason dictates it; I would have to be mad to do otherwise, and since I happen not to be mad, I cannot do otherwise. (Notice, by the way, that we say it was “up to” Luther whether or not to recant, and we do not feel tempted to rescind that judgment when we learn that he claimed he could do no other. Notice, too, that we often say things like this: “If it were up to me, I know for certain what I would do.”)”

        <p>"I hope it is true - and I think it very likely is true - that it would be impossible to induce me to torture an innocent person by offering my a thousand dollars. 'Ah' - comes the objection - 'but what if some evil space pirates were holding the whole world ransom, and promised not to destroy it if only you would torture an innocent person? Would that be something you find impossible to do?' Probably not, but so what? That is a vastly different case. If what one is interested in is whether under the <em>under the specified circumstances</em> I could have done otherwise, then the other case mentioned is entirely irrelevant. I claimed it would not be possible to torture someone <em> for a thousand dollars</em>. Those who hold dear the principle of 'could have done otherwise' are always insisting that we should look at whether one could have done otherwise in exactly the same circumstances. I claim something stronger; I claim that I could not do otherwise even in any roughly similar case. I would <em> never agree </em> to torture an innocent person for a thousand dollars. It would make no difference, I claim, what tone of voice the briber used, or whether or not I was tired and hungry, or whether the proposed victim was well illuminated or partially concealed in shadow. I am, I hope, immune to all such offers." - Daniel Dennett, Elbow Room.  </p>
